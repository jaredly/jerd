// Yes please

// functions need to own their type variables.
// Default to put them at the closest lambda.

// At the end of unification, all type variables need a home.
// Also, have the "unique" for type variables
// be global maybe? or no, rewrite the type
// variables to new ones when bringing in a term
// that contains type variables.
// Also note that we should be able to call
// a generic function multiple times
// with different instantiations of the types.
const callOne = <T,>(f: (int, string) => T) => f(2, "hi")
// const test2 = () => callOne((a, b) => log(b))
