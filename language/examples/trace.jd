// START HERE maybe: retyping might not be resetting the `term` nextTraceId correctly? getting a retyping error.
// Soooo I could just allow `trace#0!` as syntax, which would lock things down
// but then I'd have to verify that all traces were unique probably? And also idk
// ??

// n - 1
const otherTerm = (n: int): int => trace!(n - 1, "Yes")
// m + 3
const oneTerm = (m: int): int => trace!(m, "Hello from tracing!") + trace!(otherTerm(4))

// 7 + 4
oneTerm(4) + oneTerm(1) == 11
