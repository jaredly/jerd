// ooooh also an annotation could be the macro that was invoked to produce this code ðŸ¤”
// so, what happens if you update a macro?
// you can choose to re-run the places that was run.
// ohhh and macros *definitely* have access to full type information, on everything up to where they are.
// and if they use something that doesn't have an annotation yet (or inferred), then we just ask the
// use what the type should be. Right?

// Uhhh I should probably be making the compiler in javascript, shouldn't I.
// so that it can be web-ready from the get-go. Yeah.
// ugh but I want rich case statements and stuff.

// Ok, is there any benefit to "modular implicitst editor?
// Ok, is there any benefit to "modular implicits" in a world with a sufficiently-smart editor?

// One-owner types is nice, lets us do "controlled mutation"
// a one-owner type can be "released" to be multi-owner (the normal state of things)
// but you can't go the other way around, without a `copy()`.
// Yeah having affine types would be super cool.
// Do I care about "relevant" types? depends on what "used" means I guess. probably not.

// ugh does that mean all function arguments need a potential "mut" keyword? hrm I guess.
// but no borrowing. if you have a mut thing, you are definitely the only one, right? well
// no I guess we can borrow. uh it just means uh you can't hm store it anywhere if you have a borrow.
// hmmmmmm this is a little more complicated.
// so we have "move" and "mut". "move" is also "mut".
// if you want an arg to be "move" hm
